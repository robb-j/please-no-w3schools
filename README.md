# please-no-w3schools

Put a big red line through w3schools.com links in [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) search results.
This browser extension only adds [no-w3schools.css](/no-w3schools.css) to `duckduckgo.com` pages.
The line and opacity of w3schools links are reset on hover if you are desperate.
